    <h3>Hi,</h3>
    <p>I completed my MSc. from RWTH Aachen in Aug 2025, and built a passion for Digital Twins, combining physical models with data-driven models, AI, sustainable tech and a special interest in Project.
      This website is a brief insight into me! I will use this space to share projects, experiences and thoughts. Feel free to reach out to me!</p>

**Projects**

1. Digital Twin Research

*Tech stack:* Python, Julia, Modelica, scikit-learn, matplotlib, TensorFlow, Windows, Linux

- Modelled the drying section of the paper manufacturing process in an Object Oriented format by using and modifying a previously developed Modelica library (DryLib) and by modelling environmental parameters from (Paper Link) to have an energy consumption estimation for different scenarios and setups of paper drying.
- Exported FMUs of 6 different configurations of the drying section, according to use cases specified by partner companies.
- Run simulations with CVODE solver on these FMUs using Python (omsimulator package used) and Julia (FMI.jl package used).
