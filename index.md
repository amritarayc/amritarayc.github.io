    <h3>Hi,</h3>
    <p>I completed my MSc. from RWTH Aachen in Aug 2025, and developed my passion in Digital Twins, combining physical models with data-driven models, AI, sustainable tech and some special interest in Project Management.</p>  
    <p>This website is a brief insight into me! I will use this space to share projects, experiences and thoughts. Feel free to reach out to me! :) </p>
